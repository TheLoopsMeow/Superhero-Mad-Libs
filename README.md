This is a random mad-lib generator based on superheros!  The text of the superhero bios and images are from Wikipedia.  

All of the code in this project was created by me.

An additional feature I may built out in the futuer is a function to determine if a word is a verb, adverb, noun, or adjective, and only replace words that meet that criteria, which would make for a better user experience.  Currently, articles and conjunctions are replaced as well.
