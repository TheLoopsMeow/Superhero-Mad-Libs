This is a random mad-lib generator based on superheros!  The text of the superhero bios and images are from Wikipedia.  

All of the code in this project was created by me.

An additional feature I may built out in the futuer is a function to determine if a word is a verb, adverb, noun, or adjective, and only replace words that meet that criteria, which would make for a better user experience.  Currently, articles and conjunctions are replaced as well.

Issues:
Site currently not working.  Line 45 of index.js, which deals with image URLs seems to be stopping the site from running.  It appears to only occur when an image URL has a hash symbol in it.
